# Computational & Statistical Systems Biology Laboratory
@ National University of Singapore

CSSB Laboratory develops computational and statistical solutions for the analysis of high-dimensional molecular data in various contexts of biomedical research. These tools are motivated by a wide range of research topics, including

- Integration of multiple molecular data sets to harness systems-level biological information
- Statistical methods for ultra high-dimensional data
- Computational tool development for mass spectrometry (MS) data
- Interactive data visualization

CSSB Laboratory also provides massively parallel sequencing (or next generation sequencing (NGS)) and MS data analysis support for basic scientists and clinical investigators through Systems Biology Core at NUHS. Our collaborative service work includes exome sequencing, epigenetic profiling, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics/lipidomics data analysis.
